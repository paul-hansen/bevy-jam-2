## Title TBD

This is a game where you control the direction of a flock of birds, and your goal is to combine your flock with all the other flocks while maintaining control.
You can only merge with flocks that are smaller than your flock though, or they will take over your flock instead.

This game was made for the Bevy game jam #2 which you can [find here](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2). The theme of the jam is "Combine".

Inspired by the likes of [snake.io](https://snake.io) and [Galcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcon).

## Try it out
You can try it [in your web browser](https://prawl.itch.io/bevy-game-jam-2?secret=muIxabT0urrjAbmM4MqhtxifGR4).

Or you can find the latest download under ["assets" here](https://github.com/paul-hansen/bevy-jam-2/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

## Project status
It's very WIP right now, it only has a basic [boid behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) implemented (and even that can use some work). Fun to play around with the settings though.
