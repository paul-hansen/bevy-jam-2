## Flock Fusion

Grow your flock by taking over other flocks,
but be careful, if you lose your leader to another flock it's game over.

This game was made for Bevy Jam #2 which you can [find here](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2). The theme of the jam is "Combine".

Inspired by the likes of [snake.io](https://snake.io) and [Galcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcon).

Version 0.4.0 is the version that was submitted to the jam, I've made some updates and fixes since then.

## Try it out
You can try it [in your web browser](https://prawl.itch.io/flock-fusion).

Or you can find the latest download under ["assets" here](https://github.com/paul-hansen/bevy-jam-2/releases/latest).

### Known issues

- If you are captured and there are more than two remaining colors you will still be watching the game, until there is only one left. Press escape to open the menu to restart early.
