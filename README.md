## Title TBD

This is a game where you control the direction of a group of `[birds?]`, and your goal is to combine your group with all the other flocks while maintaining control.
You can only merge with groups that are smaller than your group though, or they will take over your group instead.

This game was made for the Bevy game jam #2 which you can [find here](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2). The theme of the jam is "Combine".

Inspired by the likes of [snake.io](https://snake.io) and [Galcon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galcon).

## Try it out
You can try it [in your web browser](https://prawl.itch.io/bevy-game-jam-2?secret=muIxabT0urrjAbmM4MqhtxifGR4).

Or you can find the latest download under ["assets" here](https://github.com/paul-hansen/bevy-jam-2/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

## Project status

You can fly around, collect followers and take out other groups.

### Known issues

- There is no win or loose screen. If you get captured you have to press escape to open the menu and restart.
- Followers don't separate correctly and will overlap each other.
- The capture logic could use some work to seem more "fair". Sometimes your group will lose to a smaller one simply because their group is more densely packed.
